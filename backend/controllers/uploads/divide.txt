Feature: Division operation
  As a user
  I want to divide one number by another
  So that I can get the correct quotient or an appropriate error message

  Background:
    Given a calculator is initialized

  Scenario: Divide two positive numbers
    When I divide 10 by 2
    Then the result should be 5

  Scenario: Divide a positive number by a negative number
    When I divide 10 by -2
    Then the result should be -5

  Scenario: Divide a negative number by a positive number
    When I divide -10 by 2
    Then the result should be -5

  Scenario: Divide two negative numbers
    When I divide -10 by -2
    Then the result should be 5

  Scenario: Divide a number by 1
    When I divide 25 by 1
    Then the result should be 25

  Scenario: Divide a number by itself
    When I divide 15 by 15
    Then the result should be 1

  Scenario: Divide zero by a number
    When I divide 0 by 5
    Then the result should be 0

  Scenario: Divide a number by zero
    When I divide 5 by 0
    Then an error should be shown with message "Cannot divide by zero"

  Scenario: Divide zero by zero
    When I divide 0 by 0
    Then an error should be shown with message "Indeterminate form"

  Scenario: Divide a decimal number by a whole number
    When I divide 7.5 by 3
    Then the result should be 2.5

  Scenario: Divide a whole number by a decimal
    When I divide 10 by 4.0
    Then the result should be 2.5

  Scenario: Divide two decimal numbers
    When I divide 9.6 by 3.2
    Then the result should be 3

  Scenario: High precision division
    When I divide 1 by 3
    Then the result should be approximately 0.3333 with a tolerance of 0.0001
