Business Requirements Document (BRD): Basic Calculator Web App
Document Version: 1.0 Date: May 23, 2025 Prepared By: Product Owner

1. Introduction
This Business Requirements Document (BRD) outlines the high-level business needs and objectives for the development of a basic web-based calculator application. The primary purpose of this initiative is to provide a readily accessible and efficient tool for users to perform fundamental arithmetic calculations directly within their web browser.

2. Business Objectives
The key business objectives for this project are:
Enhance User Productivity: To offer a quick and reliable digital tool for everyday numerical computations, thereby improving efficiency for users who require simple arithmetic on demand.
Improve User Experience: To provide a straightforward, intuitive, and error-resistant interface for basic calculations, minimizing user frustration.
Establish Foundational Capability: To build a robust base for future enhancements, potentially including more complex mathematical functions, unit conversions, or historical logging.

3. Scope
3.1 In-Scope Functionality
The initial release of the Basic Calculator Web App will include the following core capabilities:
Numerical Input: Ability to accept two distinct numerical values from the user.
Basic Arithmetic Operations: Support for the four fundamental arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Result Display: Clear and immediate presentation of the computed result.
Fundamental Error Notification: Mechanisms to inform the user about invalid operations (e.g., division by zero) or non-numerical input.
3.2 Out-of-Scope Functionality (for this phase)
The following functionalities are not part of this initial phase and will be considered for future iterations:
Advanced mathematical functions (e.g., trigonometry, logarithms, powers).
Unit conversions (e.g., currency, length, weight).
Operation history or memory functions.
Graphing capabilities.
Integration with external data sources.
User accounts or personalization.

4. Key Stakeholders
The primary stakeholders for this project include:
Product Owner: Defines requirements, prioritizes features, and ensures business value.
Development Team: Responsible for building and deploying the application.
Quality Assurance Team: Ensures the application meets specified requirements and is free of defects.
End Users: Individuals who will utilize the calculator for their daily arithmetic needs.

5. Success Metrics
The success of this project will be measured by the following criteria:
Functionality: All specified in-scope features are implemented and operate correctly according to the defined requirements.
Reliability: The application performs calculations accurately and consistently without crashes or unexpected behavior.
User Adoption (Future): While not directly measured in this initial phase, the design should encourage ease of use that supports future high adoption rates.
Minimal Defects: The application is released with a low number of critical or major defects.
