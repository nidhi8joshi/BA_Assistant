Document Title: PDF Password Protection Implementation Document Version: 1.0 Date: June 05, 2025 Author(s):[Your Name/Team Name] Stakeholders: [List Key Stakeholders, e.g., Business Operations, IT, Legal, Customer Service]

1. Introduction
This document outlines the business requirements for enhancing the security of PDF documents generated and sent to users via email within the [Your Application Name/System Name] system. Currently, these PDFs are sent without any password protection. The proposed enhancement aims to implement password protection for all user-specific PDF documents to improve data confidentiality and security.
2. Business Objectives
The primary objectives of this initiative are:
Enhance Data Security: Increase the security and confidentiality of sensitive information contained within PDFs sent to users.
Meet Compliance (Optional): Potentially align with internal security policies or external regulatory requirements for data handling (if applicable).
Improve User Trust: Provide users with a sense of enhanced security regarding their personal documents.
Reduce Risk of Unauthorized Access: Minimize the risk of unauthorized individuals accessing sensitive PDF content if an email is compromised.
3. Current State
Currently, the [Your Application Name/System Name] system generates user-specific PDF documents (e.g., invoices, statements, reports) and sends them to designated users via email. These PDFs are not encrypted or password-protected, allowing anyone with access to the email to open and view the document directly.
4. Proposed State
In the proposed state, all user-specific PDF documents generated by the [Your Application Name/System Name] system will be password-protected before being sent to the respective users via email.
4.1. Password Generation Logic
The password for each PDF will be dynamically generated based on user-specific data, following this logic:
Password Structure: [First 4 letters of User's First Name (lowercase)] + [4-digit Year from User's Date of Birth]
Examples:
User 1:
First Name: "John"
Date of Birth: "15/03/1990"
Generated Password: john1990
User 2:
First Name: "Alice"
Date of Birth: "20/07/1985"
Generated Password: alic1985
4.2. PDF Encryption/Protection
The generated password will be used as the user password for the PDF.
Users must enter this password to open and view the PDF document.
Permissions (To be confirmed with IT/Security):
The PDF should allow printing.
The PDF should allow copying of text (if acceptable from a business perspective).
The PDF should not allow modification of content.
5. Scope
5.1. In-Scope
Implementation of password generation logic based on user's first name and date of birth.
Integration of PDF password protection capabilities into the existing PDF generation process.
Applicability to all currently generated user-specific PDF documents.
5.2. Out-of-Scope
Changing the underlying PDF generation library/framework (unless required for password protection capabilities).
Implementing multi-factor authentication for PDF access.
Storing user passwords within the system (passwords are generated on-the-fly).
Retroactively password-protecting previously sent PDFs.
6. Functional Requirements
FR-001: The system shall extract the first name and date of birth for the target user from the [Specify Data Source, e.g., User Database].
FR-002: The system shall derive the first 4 characters of the user's first name, converting them to lowercase. 
FR-003: The system shall extract the 4-digit year from the user's date of birth.
FR-004: The system shall concatenate the processed first name characters and the 4-digit year to form the PDF password.
FR-005: The PDF generation process shall apply the generated password as the "user password" to the PDF document.
FR-006: The PDF shall be configured to allow printing by the user.
FR-007: The PDF shall be configured to allow copying of text by the user (pending confirmation).
FR-008: The PDF shall be configured to disallow modification of content by the user.


7. Non-Functional Requirements
NFR-001 (Performance): The addition of password protection should not significantly impact the PDF generation and email sending performance.
NFR-002 (Security): The password generation process must not store plain-text passwords.
NFR-003 (Usability): The method of communicating the password must be clear and intuitive for the end-user.
NFR-004 (Reliability): The password generation and protection process must be robust and handle edge cases (e.g., missing data, invalid data formats) gracefully.
NFR-005 (Auditability): The system should ideally log events related to PDF generation and sending (without logging passwords).
8. Assumptions
Access to user's first name and date of birth data is consistently available 
The existing PDF generation framework supports adding password protection.
Stakeholders agree on the chosen password generation logic.
9. Constraints
The solution must integrate with the existing [Your Application Name/System Name] architecture.
Minimal disruption to current PDF generation and email delivery workflows.
10. Success Criteria
All user-specific PDFs generated and sent are successfully password-protected according to the specified logic.
Users can successfully open their PDFs using the provided password.
No significant increase in PDF generation or email sending failures.
Positive feedback from users regarding the security enhancement (if user feedback is collected).
